# Dissolve
## What is Dissolve?
Dissolve is a custom version of Discord made using Neutralino.js. It is based on my old Discord client, [CustomCord](https://github.com/trisn0w/CustomCord).
It barely takes up any memory, and it's really fast (so if you have a not so good PC, this is sure to work on your system)!
